### Shiny Guesser

Player is prompted with an image of a pokemon.
The player must make a guess whether the pokemon is normal or shiny variant.
Correct guesses increase streak while incorrect guesses reset it. Each run is also timed.
After run has ended, the player is asked if they want to save their score, and if so, prompted for username.
Username is then saved alongside with the streak and time to the database, and displayed on the leaderboard.
